## General info
As the satellite moves around the orbit, the sky view rendered as seen by a camera positioned in the direction of velocity vector.  
TLE (Two-Line Elements) is used for calculating positions around orbit. For any given valid satellite in space, TLE's can be acquired from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/documentation/gp-data-formats.php) using its NORAD id.   
&nbsp;   
Example : https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?FORMAT=TLE&CATNR=44233   
&nbsp;   
Hipparcos Catalogue is used for star details and the fields extracted are      
Field H5: V magnitude    
Fields H8–9:  The right ascension, α , and declination, δ (in degrees)  


## Method   
1.  Satellite position is calculated from TLE propagation using [sgp4](https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/) library. 
2.  Right Ascension(RA) and declination(DEC) are derived from the velocity vector.   
3.  Retrieve those star details that falls within a threshold magnitude and a field of view defined by the camera.
4.  Plot and animate the starfield view as seen by the satellite.
